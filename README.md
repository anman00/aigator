# AiGator

## Project Description

AiGator is an intelligent query routing system designed to streamline user queries to the most appropriate large language model (LLM). Using an intent detection mechanism, AiGator automatically identifies the domain of a user query and routes it to the corresponding the most apropriate LLM to handle that query. If no match is found, the query is routed to a default fallback model, ensuring seamless query resolution.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.
2. **Pip**: Ensure you have `pip` for managing Python packages.
3. **Streamlit**: Install Streamlit for running the app.
4. **OpenRouter API Key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AiGator.git
    cd AiGator
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then update the empty variables with your keys:

### Running the Application

1. Launch the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the app.

-- If the above doesn't work, you can try making a virtual environment as such:

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    eg.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venvname
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment (Virtual Environment name in example is `venv`):

    - **Windows**:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **Linux/macOS**:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then update the empty variables with your keys:

5. Launch the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    path/to/your/venv - m streamlit run app.py
    ```

    eg.

    ```bash
    venv/bin/python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

6. Open the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the app.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Enter a Query**: Input your question or query in the provided text box.
2. **Click the "Ask" Button**: Allow AiGator to detect the intent and route your query.
3. **View the Response**: AiGator will display the detected intent, the model being used, and the response generated by the LLM.

### Features

- **Intent Detection**: AiGator identifies the query domain from a predefined set of categories.
- **Model Mapping**: Queries are routed to the LLM best suited for the detected intent.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If no intent matches, the query is routed to a default fallback model (`meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free`).
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of rate limits or API issues.
